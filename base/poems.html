    <p>he held me so close,</p>
    <p>he bandaged my soul.</p>
    <p>i kissed him real slow,</p>
    <p>i carresed his soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>i miss his red tongue,</p>
    <p>blotched in blue by pushpops.</p>
    <p>i miss his soft skin,</p>
    <p>i miss his essence.</p>
    <br>
    <p>he cheated so subtle,</p>
    <p>i almost didn't know.</p>
    <p>i walked to his car,</p>
    <p>and made him a dust angel of my own.</p>

    <p>we sat together on the grass</p>
    <p>his hand on my hand,</p>
    <p>the other on his chest, then mine.</p>
    <p>feeling our hearts beat,</p>
    <p>feeling them chime.</p>
